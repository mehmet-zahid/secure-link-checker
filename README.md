# Secure Link Checker

Secure Link Checker is a Flask-based web application that scans URLs for potential security threats using the VirusTotal API. It allows users to input a URL (website url), extracts domain names, and performs concurrent security scans on multiple URLs.

## Features

- Extract domain names from input website URL
- Scan multiple URLs concurrently
- Display scan results from VirusTotal
- Limit concurrent API requests to avoid rate limiting
- Dockerized application for easy deployment

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- VirusTotal API key (to be set in the `.env` file)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd secure-link-checker
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your VirusTotal API key:
   ```
   VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5001`

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5001`. Port number can be changed in `compose.yml` file
2. Enter a Website URL in the provided input field
3. Click the "Check" button to initiate the scan
4. View the scan results for each extracted URL(valid unique domain)

## Project Structure

- `src/app.py`: Main Flask application file
- `src/virustotal.py`: Module for interacting with the VirusTotal API
- `src/domain_extractor.py`: Module for extracting domain names from website url
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building the Docker image

## Limitations
